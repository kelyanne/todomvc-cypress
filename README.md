# Automation tests with cypress

This project was deleloped in order to automated the tests of a [TODO](http://todomvc-app-for-testing.surge.sh/) site using Cypress.

This repository is about content learned in the [Introduction to Cypress](https://imgur.com/a/aDGrDkU) course offered by Test Automation University. In it I could:
- Setup the cypress
- Write and organizing tests
- Access the DOM's elements and interacting with them
- Create validations for the test cases
- Run the tests through command line using Cypress CLI 
- Standardize tests with Page Object Pattern and Cypress - [you can see here](https://github.com/kelyanne/todomvc-cypress/tree/master/cypress/page-objects)
- Create visual validations using Applitools eyes - [you can see here](https://github.com/kelyanne/todomvc-cypress/blob/master/cypress/integration/todomvc-visuals.spec.js)
- Test the same website in differents devices and - resolutions using Applitools eyes [you can see here](https://github.com/kelyanne/todomvc-cypress/blob/master/cypress/integration/todomvc-visuals.spec.js)
